App Name: Token Dormant Supply Detector

Description:
Token Dormant Supply Detector is a Mini App that tracks long-inactive token holdings across blockchain networks and identifies when dormant wallets suddenly become active. By analyzing wallet inactivity periods, awakening patterns, and supply movements, users can detect early signals of potential market shifts or whale activity.

Key Features:
 • Real-time monitoring of long-inactive token supplies
 • Alerts when dormant wallets reactivate or move funds
 • Analysis of wallet inactivity duration and awakening trends
 • Historical data on dormant supply movements
 • Dashboard to follow selected tokens and high-impact wallets

Use Case:
Perfect for traders, on-chain analysts, and investors who want to detect hidden accumulation, early whale movements, or potential market volatility driven by reactivated dormant supply.

The changes that will satisfy the request involve two files:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the exported `title` and `description` values to match the new app description.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo image to be generated.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized logo featuring a dormant wallet icon with a subtle glow, set against a dark background. The wallet is depicted as a closed, slightly translucent rectangle with a small lock symbol in the center, indicating inactivity. A faint, glowing outline surrounds the wallet, suggesting potential activation. The overall design is minimalistic, using a monochrome palette of dark gray and white, with a subtle gradient to give depth. The background is a deep charcoal color, providing contrast to the white wallet icon and the glowing effect.
